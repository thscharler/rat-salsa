/// If a widget should be seen as pure overlay, it would define only a Popup
/// event-handler. In the event-handling functions you would call all Popup
/// event-handlers before the regular ones.

/// * Context menu. If the context-menu is active, it can consume all mouse-events
///   that fall into its range, and the widgets behind it only get the rest.
/// * Menubar. Would define _two_ event-handlers, a regular one for all events

///   function calls the popup handler first and the regular one at some time later.

/// A very broad trait for an event handler.
///
/// Ratatui widgets have two separate structs, one that implements
/// Widget/StatefulWidget and the associated State. As the StatefulWidget
/// has a lifetime and is not meant to be kept, HandleEvent should be
/// implemented for the state struct. It can then modify some state and
/// the tui can be rendered anew with that changed state.
///
/// HandleEvent is not limited to State structs of course, any Type
/// that wants to interact with events can implement it.
///
/// * Event - The actual event type.
/// * Qualifier - The qualifier allows creating more than one event-handler
///   for a widget.
///
///   This can be used as a variant of type-state, where the type given
///   selects the widget's behaviour, or to give some external context
///   to the widget, or to write your own key-bindings for a widget.
///
/// * R - Result of event-handling. This can give information to the
///   application what changed due to handling the event. This can
///   be very specific for each widget, but there is one general [Outcome]
///   that describes a minimal set of results.
///
///   There should be one value that indicates 'I don't know this event'.
///   This is expressed with the ConsumedEvent trait.

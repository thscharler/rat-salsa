    * add multi-column layout.
    * flex now correctly layout the columns.
    * add widgets()
    * add end_all()

* add form::Form
    * this replaces all the pager widgets with one widget.
        - DualPager is no longer useful with multicolumn layouts.
        - SinglePager and Form can merge and include Pager as well.
        - PageNavigation no longer needs to be a separate widget.
    * removed all useless api

## minor

* add simple_grid() layout function. supersede layout_grid() with layout_as_grid()
* Clipper: replace final widget with finish().
*
* remove Caption.

* remove unused feature 'unstable-widget-ref'

# 1.1.0

* new: Add widget `Caption` that can be used as a label.
  It can use a hotkey to set the focus to an associated widget.
  It can show the hotkey as part of the label either always, on hover
  or when the widget is focused.
    * added to SinglePager, DualPager, Form and Clipper as alternate label.

* new: PairedWidget is a wrapper for widgets. With this wrapper a Widget
  can be paired with a StatefulWidget for display.

* fix: SinglePager shows the first page if called with an unknown widget.
* fix: Display of the next page was wrong with DualPager.
* fix: Form, Pager, SinglePager, DualPager: render_label had a broken api. fix.
* fix: Split adds a few length checks and ignores some out-of-bounds requests.

  disable default label rendering.
* feature: View: add Style for areas outside the rendered view.
* feature: MsgDialogState::new_active() added.

* fix: MsgDialogState: missing new()
* fix: Hover should be marked as unstable.

# 1.0.4

* feature: Splitter: simplify usage with new into_widget_layout()
  which doesn't need the split-widget approach any longer.
* fix: Splitter: hidden splits shouldn't be resizable.
* feature: Form: add block() and style()
* feature: SingePager, DualPager, Form, Clipper: allow setting the layout
  with the widget. just forward to the state.

# 1.0.3

* fix: Rendering of selection in Month. Use underlined
  for lead instead of reversed().

# 1.0.2

* feature: Choice: add reverse_select_by_char()

# 1.0.1

* fix: ensure that the select_style is always patched onto the
  base-style. This makes a select-style `Style::new().underlined()`
  work fine.

# 1.0.0

... jump ...

# 0.37.2

* fix: Choice: manual popup-len should still consider number
  of items.
* feature: Choice: add width() and height() to ChoiceWidget; add
  layout() to ChoicePopup
* feature: FileDialog: use F1-F5 to jump to different parts.

# 0.37.1

* feature: add Hover widget
* fix: MsgDialog should focus the text.
* fix: use dirs instead of directories_next.

# 0.37.0

* break: CalendarSelection: remove clear()
* break: CalendarSelection: rename len() to count()
* break: Button: rebuild hot-key. make a very, very minimal thing
  that works with button.
* break: ListSelection add count()
* break: Pager&Co: add try_label_str_for() and try_label_str() for
  optional results. default returns "" as default for missing labels.
* feature: add new widget Form that further reduces the surface
  at the price of loosing functionality.

# 0.36.0

* break: full rebuild of the calendar module
    * add a Selection model
        * NoSelection
            * navigation but no selection
        * SingleSelection
            * single date selection + all the navigation.
        * RangeSelection
            * select date ranges
            * week/month selection
    * add Ctrl+Home for go to today.
    * add Home/End for start/end of month.
    * add click+drag selection for days and weeks
    *
    * add CalendarState for a true multi-month calendar. there is no default widget using
      this, as there are many possible layouts.
    * add Calender3 as a simple scrolling 3-month calendar. Using CalendarState.
    * rename MonthStyle to CalendarStyle

* break: Choice: remove Regular event-handling and do everything
  in the Popup event handler. Simplifies usage.

* fix: Choice eventhandling.
    * move_to, move_up and move_down now return a ChoiceOutcome to cover all of the behaviour.
    * event-handling for the popup is tricky. rewritten to make it more stable.
    * add PageUp/Down, Home, End key handling.
* fix: Splitter now does the base style correctly.

* feature: Splitter: use alt+ArrowKey for split navigation.
* feature: Splitter: add horizontal() and vertical() constructors.
* feature: Paired: can work with Widget now.

# 0.35.0

* break: ButtonOutcome moved to the event module as all the other
  Outcome types.
* break: add CheckOutcome::Value, ChoiceOutcome::Value, RadioOutcome::Value
  and SliderOutcome::Value to signal changed values separate from other
  changes.
* break: Outcome types are no longer non_exhaustive. Any change to an
  outcome type is breaking regardless of this flag.
* break: create ChoiceCore to define common behaviour between Choice
  and Radio.
    - Both can work with empty lists of choices now.
      They preserve any value set with set_value() regardless if it is
      present in the list. Such an undefined value will be displayed
      with all unchecked radios or an empty choice. This gives decent
      behaviour if the list of choices diverges from the actual data.
      At least it prevents a silent reset.
    - Adds back default_value semantics. The default-value falls back
      to T::default() if not set.
* break: Clipper, SinglePager, DualPager now hold a Rc<RefCell<GenericLayout>>.
  This enables clear() to reset any current layout. This comes in handy
  if some event handling invalidates the layout. This adds valid_layout()
  to all widgets. An empty layout is always invalid. And it detects size changes.

* feature: Allow setting the navigation markers for PagerNav.
  Hide page-numbers if there is only one page. If no explicit
  border is set for PagerNav no space will be reserved for
  the navigation markers. They will render over any content.
* feature: Choice: add clear()
* feature: Choice: add behaviour flags
    - ChoiceSelect::MouseScroll - select in the popup-list with scroll.
    - ChoiceSelect::MouseMove - select in the popup-list with mouse moves.
    - ChoiceSelect::MouseClick - select in the popup-list with click and allows drag.
    - ChoiceClose::SingleClick - close popup with single click
    - ChoiceClose::DoubleClick - close popup with double click.
* feature: calendar::Month uses ISO week-numbers now.
* feature: calender::Month can now operate without setting start-date
  on the widget. It uses any start-date coming from the state.
* feature: calender: better event-handing for &[[MonthState]].
    - add a MultiMonth qualifier for event-handling. This allows
      setting a month-delta when moving beyond the displayed dates.
      It requires Focus now for correctly focusing the current Month widget.
    - Scrolling through dates outside the displayed months now changes
      the start_date in the state. So start-date must not be set
      when rendering the Month widgets.
    - Result is now plain CalOutcome::Day/CalOutcome::Week dependent on
      the actual selection.
    - PageUp/PageDown supported
* feature: Button: add hover functionality.
* feature: Clipper: add scroll_to(widget)

* fix: Choice must not send a change when it reacts to focus changes.
  The relevant repaint is already triggered by Focus itself.
  This leads to a double repaint and possible other disruptions.
* fix: Choice doesn't consume Enter and Esc if the popup is already hidden.
* fix: use unicode_display_width for Slider
* fix: LayoutForm: off by 1
* fix: Clipper renders the correct background style now.

# 0.34.0

* break: Choice: remove default_key, replace with simple select(0).
* break: Choice: change selection from optional to plain usize.
* break: Slider: refactor: change from Option<T> to T. out of bounds is
  handled differently. ease of use.
* break: Checkbox: remove default-settable. too complicated.
* fix: scrolling in Pager shouldn't consume event if nothing happened

# 0.33.1

* moved all rat-crates to one repo

# 0.33.0

* break: LayoutForm

  FormLabel::Str is split in FormLabel::Str and FormLabel::String with
  a simple &str or String as data. Makes using those much easier.
  Both behave the same otherwise.

  Remove FormLabel::Measure and FormWidget::Measure and replace them
  with min_label() and min_widget().

  FormWidget::Wide, StretchX, WideStretchX, StretchXY, WideStretchXY
  all gain a preferred width.

* break: Choice and Radio return an owned value for value().
  There are new value_ref() and value_opt_ref() that return a reference.
  Most of the time the owned value is easier to handle.

* feature: Pager et al get a few new render() methods for special cases.
* feature: add PairedWidget. Can render 2 widgets side by side in one
  layout area. There are a few simple constraints how to divide the
  space.
* feature: Pager et al allow access to the buffer during rendering.
* feature: Choice gets popup_offset()

* fix: SinglePager, DualPager ensure that the current page
  doesn't exceed page-count.
* fix: LayoutForm. StretchY doesn't work on the last page.
* fix: underflows in LayoutForm
* fix: Clipper::layout_size() must return a Size with height u16::MAX.
* fix: Pager styles labels only if expressedly set.
* fix/break: DualPager must use FnOnce for its render functions too.
* fix: Button cannot rely on Key Released. Add a flag to rat-focus
  to recognize this. The button doesn't show a 'clicked' behaviour
  if no Key Released is accessible.
* fix: Button triggered for a lone Mouse-Up event without
  a prior Mouse-Down.

# 0.32.0

* break: Replace StructuredLayout with GenericLayout
    * removes the array-based access of StructuredLayout with Label+Widget areas.
    * adds support to render arbitrary Blocks as part of the layout.
      this allows to add support for groups of widgets during
      layout calculation.

* feature: add new LayoutForm.
    * page-breaking layouts.
    * Flex support
    * widgets can fill the available width.
    * widgets can use remainder space after a page-break.
    * align labels with the widgets.
    * keep and auto-render labels.
    * allow groups of widgets with a surrounding block.
    * blocks can stack.
    * manual page-breaks.
    * line-spacing.
    * margins via Padding().
    * margins can switch between odd/even pages.

    * creates a GenericLayout

* break: add Pager and PageNavigation widgets and reimplement
  SinglePager and DualPager using those.
* break: SinglePager and DualPager use GenericLayout now, breaking all of their api.
* break: Clipper uses GenericLayout now, breaking all of their api.
* break: remove separate ClipperLayout and PagerLayout. Layout now only
  needs a single stage and creates a GenericLayout directly.
* break: layout_edit() reimplemented. Creates a GenericLayout now.
* break: layout_dialog() reimplemented. Creates a GenericLayout now.
* break: layout_grid() reimplemented. Creates a GenericLayout now.

* break: add a value type T to Choice and Radio. This makes
  them so much easier to use, as the underlying values never
  align with the displayed text. Requires only PartialEq from T.
* fix: show focus for Choice

# 0.31.0

* remove uses of ZRect. Choice now adds two areas for its parts.

# 0.30.0

** upgrade to ratatui 0.29 **

* break: removed View and Viewport. These container widgets are
  not good enough. and cumbersome to work with.

* add new View and the view-like Clipper, SinglePager and DualPager widgets.
    * Clipper minimizes the required rendering.
    * SinglePager/DualPager don't scroll but page.
      These don't use a temporary Buffer.
* add new StructuredLayout as a collection of Rect.
    * the various layout_xx() return one.
    * ClipperLayout and PagerLayout use it.
* add Checkbox widget
* add Radio widget
* add Slider widget
*
* feature: make Paragraph more useable. Add focus-style.
* feature: add width() and height() to the widgets with a known/required size.
* feature: show weekdays in Month widget.
* feat: implement RelocatableState for most widgets.
* fix: button click is not visible in some terminals. add armed_delay()
  as a primitive fix, which just sleeps for a few milliseconds.
  that's enough time for the terminal to render the armed-state
  before switching to clicked-state.
* fix: keyboard resizing of Split
* fix: allow drag to select tabs.
* check fallbacks when no styling is applied. across all widgets.

* refactor: styles for FileDialog
* fix: revert_style()
* fix: arg order in reset_buf_area()

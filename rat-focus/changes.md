# 1.2.0

* docs
* fix: don't reexport rat-event.
* fix: when setting the focus to a container, set to the first
  *navigable* widget instead of just the first.
* fix: remove FocusTraversal. Not useful enough.

* feature: add Focus::future() to set the focus to a widget
  not yet in the widget list.

# 1.1.1

* fix: impl_has_focus! should use full path for Rect.

# 1.1.0

* break: match_focus doesn't work any more with changes in macro_rules!
  changed fallback branch from '_' to 'else'

* fix: Focus::handle() event shouldn't return 'Unchanged' but 'Continue'
  for unprocessed events.
* feature: add HasFocus::id() as a unique identifier for a widget.
  Returns a unique usize value. Allow focusing by this id. This is
  for interop with other subsystems where using the FocusFlag feels
  strange.
* Add a qualifier FocusTraversal for event-handling.
  This is used by TextArea to provide alternative navigation keys instead
  of tab. Uses Esc to focus the next widget after a TextArea.

# 1.0.2

* update dependencies

# 1.0.1

* add some inlines

# 1.0.0

# 0.33.1

* feature: Focus: add next_force() and prev_force() to overcome
  navigation blocking.

# 0.33.0

* break: rename append_leaf() to leaf_widget()
* break: rename append_flags() to widget_with_flags()
* break: remove focus_flag_no_lost() no longer necessary.
* break: rename first_container() to first_in()
* break: start_with_flags() no longer accepts an optional FocusFlag. Useless feature.

* feature: first_in() now accepts plain widgets.

# 0.32.1

* fix: some docs

# 0.32.0

* BREAK: renames & refactors
    * FocusBuilder::for_container -> build_for
    * FocusBuilder::rebuild -> rebuild_for
    * FocusBuilder::add_widget -> append_flags
    * FocusBuilder::start_container -> start_with_flags
    * refactor: move functionality from HasFocus::build() to FocusBuilder::append_leaf()
    * refactor: remove impl for HasFocus::build(). Implementing this
      for simple widgets is not the default use case irl.
      These changes give better code language and better defaults.

* feature: Add focus_id() to FocusFlag to get a basic ID for a widget.
    - Alternative to storing the FocusFlag itself.
    - Doesn't persist, runtime only.
* feature: add impl_has_focus! macro.
    - ```impl_has_focus!(container_flag:area: widget1, widget2, widget3 for SomeComposit)```
    - ```impl_has_focus!(container_flag: widget1, widget2, widget3 for SomeComposit)```
    - ```impl_has_focus!(widget1, widget2, widget3 for SomeComposit)```
* fix: Better log messages.

# 0.31.0

* BREAK: Remove ContainerFlag and relatives.
  Since the addition of HasFocus::build() this separate trait
  has become more and more useless. And is now removed completely.
* break: remove focus_container(). focus() does all the work.

# 0.30.2

* moved all rat-crates to one repo

# 0.30.1

* feature: add widgets() which can take an array of `dyn HasFocus` and
  add all to the focus. convenience.
* fix: mouse focus reported a change even if the focus stays on the same
  widget after a mouse click.

# 0.30.0

* Add Hash to FocusFlag and ContainerFlag. With this addition those
  two now can act as unique id to reference a widget from other subsystems.

* perf: add an internal hashset to improve 'contains' checks.
  This removes the last O(n) when adding a widget. There is still a
  loop when adding a container, but that one corresponds with the
  depth of the widget tree, so it should be fine.

# 0.29.0

* break: remove ZRect. This was insufficient at the end, and the perf was not so good too.

  Replaced HasFocus::z_areas() with HasFocus::area_z() which returns a single z-value
  for the area. Now the same FocusFlag can now be added for a further areas as long
  as it only uses Navigation::Mouse for these. This is good enough for popups.

  Adds FocusContainer::area_z(). The z_area for a widget is now calculated starting
  from the base-z value of the surrounding container. And containers within containers
  stack one upon the other. When container and widget areas are encountered with
  the same z-value, widgets get prioritized.

  This gives a clean stacking now, and can satisfy window like structures.

* Focus::clone_destruct() gives a clone of the internal structures for debugging.

# 0.28.0

** upgrade to ratatui 0.29 **

* feature: add support for rat-reloc. adds relocate_z_area() and relocate_z_areas()

# 0.27.1

* feature: add ZRect::union_all(), ZRect::union()

# 0.27.0

Final renames.

* HasFocusFlag changes to HasFocus.
* current HasFocus changes to FocusContainer.

# 0.26.0

Missed a few things:

break: The functions is_focused(), lost_focus() and gained_focus() of HasFocus
can clash with the same in HasFocusFlag. Renamed the HasFocus functions to
is_container_focused(), container_lost_focus() and container_gained_focus().
break: FocusAdapter gets a const type param and adds z_areas. Can now emulate
a full widget.

feature: add Focus::none() to reset all focus flags.
feature: add ContainerAdapter analogous to FocusAdapter.
feature: add Focus::expel_focus() and Focus::expel_focus_container().
The expel the focus from the given widget/container and place it elsewhere.

fix: focus_container() should always focus regardless of navigation flags.
add first_container() that respects navigations-flags.
fix: update_container and replace_container used an outdated method to
build a container.

# 0.25.0

Sync version for beta.

Last big changes ...

* break: Reimagined focus init.

    - Focus looses most functions to modify the widget
      structure. And it's constructors. Only the container
      rebuild fn update_container(), replace_container()
      and remove_container() remain. All construction goes
      to FocusBuilder.

    - FocusBuilder. Classic builder for Focus, only
      a widget() and a container() fn remain for this.
      But those are fluent fn's so it's ok.

    - HasFocus gained a build() method which takes
      a FocusBuilder. This saves a few Vecs, and
      builder style is quite nice for focus construction.

      container() and area() have solid fallbacks.

    - add FocusBuilder::for_container() and FocusBuilder::rebuild() that
      can work with a &dyn HasFocus.

* Add Focus::focus_container() to focus the first widget.
* Add Navigation::Lock. Lock the focus with the current
  widget.
* FocusFlag now implements HasFocusFlag.
* HasFocus::area() now works without HasFocus::container() existing.

# 0.12.1

* fix docs

# 0.12.0

* update ratatui to 0.28

# 0.11.0

* break: rename Focus::init() to Focus::initial()
* break: remove the lifetime from Focus.
  FocusFlags now contain a Rc<> of the flags, and when constructing
  the Focus a clone of the Rc<> is used inside Focus. This makes Focus
  more generally usable.
* break: Containers get their own ContainerFlag which works the same
  as FocusFlag for widgets. Avoids confusion of the two.
* break: trait HasFocus has been extended for better container support.
* break: replace the HasFocus::navigable() result with it's own
  enum for fine grain control of widget/focus interaction.
* break: change the name in FocusFlag to Box<str> to allow non-static names.

* feature: FocusFlags can now be compared. It uses Rc::ptr_eq for
  comparison.
* feature: add functions to manipulate the focus-list after construction.
  Allows adding/removing/replacing widgets and containers.
*

# 0.10.5

* change FocusFlag::set() to take a bool
* fix: areas for sub-containers must be checked before the area of the container.
  otherwise they probably never get a hit via mouse.

# 0.10.4

* feature: Add ZRect, a Rect with z-order. HasFocusFlag can not only return
  one Rect as the focusable area, but multiple ZRects for component-area +
  popup area.
* feature: Add HasFocusFlag::navigable(), denotes if a field can be reached
  with normal keyboard focus.
* refactor: Rename Focus::new_accu to new_container.

# 0.10.3

feature: add name for Focus debugging.
fix: lost&gained shouldn't be set if the focus stays the same. there might
be an exception for single field focus lists, but I think this should not be covered here.

# 0.10.2

* feature: add HasFocus trait for container widgets.
    * adds Focus::add_flag(), Focus::add_container() and
    * renames Focus::append() to Focus::add_focus()

* add Focus::new_grp() for groups of widgets.
* add FocusFlag::name field for debugging.
* add Focus::enable_log() for debugging.
* add Focus::clear()
* add Focus::focused(), Focus::lost_focus(), Focus::gained_focus()
  to get the current state.

# 0.10.1

* add focus_widget_no_lost and focus_widget which use the HasFocusFlag trait. Ease of use.
* add init() to set the initial focus and clear the rest.

# 0.10.0

* upstream change in rat-event.

# 0.9.1

* Fix versions

# 0.9.0

* Initial copy from the test area.
